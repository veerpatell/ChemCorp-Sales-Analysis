## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Tableau-driven analysis of ChemCorp's 2015 sales transactions. The goal is to uncover actionable insights across three key business areas:

- **Market Segmentation** – Understand customer segments and regional performance.
- **Market Opportunity** – Identify segments and products with highest profitability.
- **Product Divestment** – Pinpoint underperforming products or segments for divestment.

This work is structured using Tableau visualizations and backed by data exploration in Excel.
